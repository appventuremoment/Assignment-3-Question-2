## Common Password Weaknesses and Best Practices
Use 2FA

a. Short length

Passwords under 8â€“10 characters are much easier to brute-force.

Every additional character exponentially increases the number of possible combinations.

b. Predictable patterns

Keyboard sequences: qwerty, asdf123, 1q2w3e.

Repeated characters: aaaaaa, 111111.

Common substitutions (but still predictable): P@ssw0rd instead of Password.

c. Dictionary words

Words or combinations from a dictionary (any language) are vulnerable to dictionary attacks.

Variants like Summer2025! or Football123 are weak.

d. Personal information

Names, birthdays, phone numbers, favorite sports teams, pet names.

Easily found on social media or through social engineering.

e. Reused passwords

Leetspeak/Dictionary + number or symbol are not safe either


sbjqa random 5 length password with only lowercase letters
